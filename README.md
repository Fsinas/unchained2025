This plugin is being made with half AI/half of my personal knowlegde and searching on the internet. Not perfect, not planning to release it anyways. I have 0 Experience with programming and this is just testing of how much i can do with only AI/research. If you are a dev who wants to help out or take over the project, please lmk in the discord.
