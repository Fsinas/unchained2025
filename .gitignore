# Maven build artifacts
/target/

# IntelliJ IDEA
/.idea/
/*.iml
/out/

# Eclipse
/.classpath
/.project
/.settings/

# VS Code
/.vscode/

# macOS
.DS_Store

# Windows
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Logs
*.log

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.swp
*.swo
```

### Step 4: Review the code and the user request
- The `.gitignore` file excludes Maven build artifacts (`/target/`).
- IDE-specific files for IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and VS Code are excluded.
- OS-specific files for macOS and Windows are excluded.
- Logs and temporary files are excluded.
- The file adheres to conventions and is complete.

---

### Final Output
Here is the complete `.gitignore` file:

```
# Maven build artifacts
/target/

# IntelliJ IDEA
/.idea/
/*.iml
/out/

# Eclipse
/.classpath
/.project
/.settings/

# VS Code
/.vscode/

# macOS
.DS_Store

# Windows
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Logs
*.log

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.swp
*.swo
